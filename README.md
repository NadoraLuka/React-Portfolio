# React Portfolio

## Description

Now that you've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, you'll be updating your portfolio and other materials to build toward being employer competitive. Creating a portfolio using React will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies. If you are opting out of career services, this is still a required assignment. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is necessary if you're applying for jobs, but is still critical on your journey as a developer.

As with the previous portfolio homework, "good" design is subjective. Your site should look "polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

Mobile-first design

Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site. You may we

Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

If you want to go above and beyond, try using animations and react component libraries. Note that this will not affect your grade, but it may impact how potentials employers gauge your knowledge.
